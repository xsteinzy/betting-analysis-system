## 📊 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

With sufficient training data (100+ player-games):

| Prop Type | Expected MAE | Expected R² | Within Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Passing Yards | 28 yards | 0.75 | 56% (±20 yards) |
| Rushing Yards | 18 yards | 0.68 | 58% (±15 yards) |
| Receiving Yards | 15 yards | 0.70 | 60% (±15 yards) |
| Passing TDs | 0.7 TDs | 0.62 | 65% (±1 TD) |
| Receptions | 1.2 receptions | 0.68 | 62% (±2) |

*Performance depends on data quality and quantity*

✅ Predictions generate for all active players
✅ Confidence scores are reasonable (not all 0 or 100)
✅ Predictions save to database
✅ Value finder identifies opportunities
✅ System runs without errors
✅ All 9 tests pass
✅ Position-aware predictions work correctly

### Production-Ready Criteria:

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**No training data**: Run `python collect_data.py --sport NFL`

**No models**: Run `python models/nfl/train_models.py`

**No games this week**: Check if it's NFL season (Sep-Jan)

**Low performance**: Need more historical data (multiple seasons)

**Position errors**: Verify position mapping in config.py

### Getting Help

1. Check `models/nfl/README.md`
2. Review `NFL_QUICKSTART.md`
3. Run `python models/nfl/example_usage.py`
4. Check logs in `logs/` directory
5. Run tests: `python scripts/test_nfl_system.py`
