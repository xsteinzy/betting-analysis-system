## üîß Installation

### 1. Install ML Dependencies

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/betting_backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import sklearn, xgboost, joblib; print('‚úì ML dependencies installed')"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Ensure You Have Data

You need historical NFL player game stats to train models:

```bash
# Collect historical NFL data
python collect_data.py --sport NFL
```

### Step 2: Train Models

Train models for all prop types:

```bash
python models/nfl/train_models.py
```

For testing with just one prop type:

```bash
python models/nfl/train_models.py --test
```

### Step 3: Generate Predictions

Generate predictions for this week's games:

```bash
python scripts/generate_nfl_predictions.py
```

That's it! Your predictions are now saved to the database.

## üìä Training Models

### Basic Training

Train models for all prop types:

```bash
python models/nfl/train_models.py
```

### Train Specific Props

Train only specific prop types:

```bash
python models/nfl/train_models.py --prop-types passing_yards rushing_yards receiving_yards
```

### Understanding Training Output

The training process will:

1. **Load Data**: Fetch historical NFL player stats from database
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create features (rolling averages, trends, etc.)
3. **Train Models**: Train 3 models per prop type (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
4. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV on training set
5. **Evaluation**: Test on held-out test set (20% of data)
6. **Save Models**: Save trained models to `models/nfl/saved_models/`

## üîÆ Generating Predictions

### Weekly Predictions Script

The main script for weekly predictions:

```bash
# Predict current week's games
python scripts/generate_nfl_predictions.py

# Predict specific week
python scripts/generate_nfl_predictions.py --week 7

# Predict only specific props
python scripts/generate_nfl_predictions.py --prop-types passing_yards rushing_yards

# Retrain models before predicting
python scripts/generate_nfl_predictions.py --retrain
```

### Unified Multi-Sport Script

Generate predictions for both NFL and NBA:

```bash
# Generate for both sports
python scripts/generate_predictions.py --sport both

# NFL only
python scripts/generate_predictions.py --sport nfl --week 7

# NBA only
python scripts/generate_predictions.py --sport nba --date 2024-10-25
```

### Python API Usage

Generate predictions programmatically:

```python
from models.nfl.predict import NFLPredictor
from database.db_manager import db_manager

# Create predictor
predictor = NFLPredictor()

# Predict current week
predictions = predictor.predict_week_games()

# Predict specific week
predictions = predictor.predict_week_games(week=7)

# Predict specific game
game_predictions = predictor.predict_game(game_id=123)

# Predict single player
single_pred = predictor.predict_single_player_prop(
    player_id=456,
    game_id=123,
    prop_type='passing_yards',
    is_home=True
)

# Save to database
predictor.save_predictions_to_db(predictions)

db_manager.close()
```

### Prediction Output Format

Each prediction contains:

```python
{
    'player_id': 456,
    'player_name': 'Patrick Mahomes',
    'position': 'QB',
    'game_id': 123,
    'game_date': '2024-10-19',
    'week': 7,
    'is_home': True,
    'prop_type': 'passing_yards',
    'predicted_value': 285.5,
    'prediction_low': 250.0,
    'prediction_high': 320.0,
    'confidence_score': 78.5,
    'model_predictions': {
        'linear_regression': 280.2,
        'random_forest': 289.1,
        'gradient_boosting': 287.2
    },
    'model_version': '1.0.0',
    'created_at': '2024-10-19T08:30:00'
}
```

## üíé Value Finder

Compare predictions to betting lines and identify value bets.

### Python API Usage

```python
from models.nfl.predict import NFLPredictor
from models.nfl.value_finder import ValueFinder

# Get predictions
predictor = NFLPredictor()
predictions = predictor.predict_week_games()

# Create value finder
value_finder = ValueFinder()

# Evaluate a bet
prediction = predictions[0]
betting_line = 265.5  # Bookmaker's line
odds = -110

over_bet = value_finder.evaluate_bet(
    prediction=prediction,
    betting_line=betting_line,
    odds=odds,
    bet_direction='over'
)

print(f"Player: {over_bet['player_name']} ({over_bet['position']})")
print(f"Week: {over_bet['week']}")
print(f"Expected Value: {over_bet['ev_pct']:+.1f}%")
print(f"Recommendation: {over_bet['recommendation']}")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

### Ensemble Approach

Each prop type uses 3 models:

1. **Linear Regression** - Fast baseline
2. **Random Forest** - Non-linear relationships, 100 trees
3. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** - Best predictive performance

**Final Prediction** = Average of all 3 models

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering

### Core Features (18 total)

1. **Rolling Averages**: Last 3, 5, 10 games
2. **Home/Away Splits**: Separate averages for home/away games
3. **Rest Days**: Days since last game (typically 6-7 for NFL)
4. **Recent Form**: Trend analysis over recent games
5. **Consistency**: Standard deviation and consistency score
6. **Snaps**: Average snaps in recent games (NFL-specific)
7. **Season Stats**: Games played, season average
8. **Opponent Metrics**: Defensive ratings (placeholder for enhancement)

### Position-Specific Props

The system only predicts relevant props for each position:

- **QB**: Passing yards, passing TDs, interceptions, completions, rushing yards
- **RB**: Rushing yards, rushing TDs, receiving yards, receptions, receiving TDs
- **WR**: Receiving yards, receptions, receiving TDs
- **TE**: Receiving yards, receptions, receiving TDs
- **K**: Field goals made

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Typical Model Performance

Based on training with sufficient data:

| Prop Type | Ensemble MAE | R¬≤ | Within Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-----|------------------|
| Passing Yards | 28 | 0.75 | 56% (¬±20 yards) |
| Rushing Yards | 18 | 0.68 | 58% (¬±15 yards) |
| Receiving Yards | 15 | 0.70 | 60% (¬±15 yards) |
| Passing TDs | 0.7 | 0.62 | 65% (¬±1 TD) |
| Receptions | 1.2 | 0.68 | 62% (¬±2) |

*Performance depends on data quality and quantity*

## üèà NFL-Specific Considerations

### Weekly Schedule

- NFL plays once per week (typically Sunday)
- Less data per season (17 games vs NBA's 82)
- Requires lower minimum games threshold (5 vs 10 for NBA)

### Position Importance

- Position determines relevant props
- QB props have highest volume
- RB/WR/TE share receiving props
- Kickers have unique props

### Season Length

- Shorter season means less training data
- Feature windows adjusted (3/5/10 games instead of larger windows)
- Cross-season data may be more valuable

### Bye Weeks

- Teams have one bye week per season
- Predictions not generated for bye weeks
- Rest days calculation accounts for bye weeks

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `models/nfl/config.py` to customize:

```python
# Prop types to predict
PROP_TYPES = ['passing_yards', 'rushing_yards', ...]

# Position-specific props
POSITION_PROP_MAPPING = {
    'QB': ['passing_yards', 'passing_touchdowns', ...],
    'RB': ['rushing_yards', 'rushing_touchdowns', ...],
    ...
}

# Training parameters
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    'test_size': 0.2,
    'min_games_required': 5,  # Lower for NFL
    'cv_folds': 5
}

# Value bet thresholds
VALUE_BET_CONFIG = {
    'strong_value_threshold': 5.0,
    'moderate_value_threshold': 2.0,
    'min_confidence_for_bet': 60,
    'min_edge_for_recommendation': 5.0  # Higher for NFL yards
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No training examples created"

**Problem**: Not enough NFL data

**Solution**:
```bash
python collect_data.py --sport NFL
```

You need at least 50+ player game stats to train models.

### "Models for X not found"

**Problem**: Models haven't been trained

**Solution**:
```bash
python models/nfl/train_models.py
```

### Low Model Performance

**Causes**:
1. Not enough training data (NFL season is shorter)
2. Position-specific data issues
3. Week-to-week variance is high in NFL

**Solutions**:
1. Collect multiple seasons of data
2. Use cross-season data
3. Tune hyperparameters for specific positions
